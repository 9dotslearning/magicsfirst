        <span class="logo">magiCSfirst</span> offers lessons about the arts of
        computer science &mdash; about interactive stories, animated drawings,
        and synthesized sound created by writing code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Written especially for middle school students,
        lessons focus on learning by tinkering.
        They use concrete examples and take small steps.
        They offer plenty of time for experimentation before focusing on formal ideas like
        syntax (the proper order of commands and symbols), structure, and
        the computer that runs the code. Skills and concepts spiral across
        lessons, re-examined repeatedly, so they have time to sink in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last but not least, the lessons each contain a little magic, I hope.
        Because learning is best when magic's first.
