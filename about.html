          <div class="triple-column">
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              I was, for 25 years, a systems manager who wished, 
              mostly vainly, to sculpt
              technology so it fit human hands. The last 10
              years of that time I was posted at an elementary school. This was a
              lucky break, since I had long since, in a hopeful and idealistic
              moment, acquired a&nbsp;masters degree in education from
              Harvard&nbsp;that was&nbsp;otherwise completely useless. At the
              elementary school, I squirreled away a little time each week to teach students in grades 2 through 9 about
              digital citizenship, troubleshooting, typing, and &mdash; most joyfully &mdash; about
              coding.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              And then I retired. But in a coincident
              twist of fate, my local school system launched a middle school computer
              science program. Since teaching computer science was the
              most joyful thing I knew, I promptly unretired.
              After that, I hung out  
              with a lively cohort of teens and tweens in a classroom of my own, making 
              art from robots, 3D websites about the kind of world we'd like to see,
              interactive stories that paint scenes with words, and all 
              the usual other suspects like Scratch,
              Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Most recently I've been
              teaching kids to make art with p5.js at <a href="https://outschool.com/teachers/Terry-D">Outschool</a>,
              where young learners from around the world can take classes in almost anything.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              <span class="logo">magiCSfirst</span> is the distillation of what those students taught me:
              in the best learning, the magic's first. When students
              find the magic, they teach you what they need to know.
            </p>

            <!--
          Written especially for beginners and particularly for tweens and teens,
          lessons focus on learning by tinkering.
          They offer concrete examples and take small steps, with
          plenty of time for experimentation before introducing formal ideas like
          syntax (the proper order of commands and symbols), structure, and
          the computer that runs the code. Skills and concepts spiral across
          lessons and are re-examined repeatedly so you'll have plenty of time to get comfortable with them.
