              The proprietor of <span class="logo">magiCSfirst</span> is Terry Dash. She did straight
              time as an information technology manager for 25 years, with the last 10
              years&nbsp;happily managing systems for an elementary school. This was a
              lucky break, since she had long since, in a hopeful and youthful
              moment, acquired a&nbsp;masters degree in education from
              Harvard&nbsp;that was&nbsp;otherwise completely useless. At the
              elementary school, she rescued a precious few moments each week from
              insatiable demands of hardware and software systems to teach students in grades 2 through 9 about
              digital citizenship, troubleshooting, typing, and &mdash; most joyfully &mdash; about
              coding.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              And then she retired. But in a completely unexpected
              twist of fate, her local school system almost simultaneously launched its first middle school computer
              science classes. Since computer science is the
              most joyful thing she knows, and teaching is the second most joyful thing,
              she unretired. For the next 8 years, she taught Scratch, Python, JavaScript,
              HTML, CSS, Twine, and robotics, and she hung out
              with a lively cohort of tweens in a classroom of her own.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              <span class="logo">magiCSfirst</span> is the distillation of what those students taught her.
              The best learning starts with a little magic. Once students feel the magic,
              they teach you what they need to know.

            <!--
          Written especially for beginners and particularly for tweens and teens,
          lessons focus on learning by tinkering.
          They offer concrete examples and take small steps, with
          plenty of time for experimentation before introducing formal ideas like
          syntax (the proper order of commands and symbols), structure, and
          the computer that runs the code. Skills and concepts spiral across
          lessons and are re-examined repeatedly so you'll have plenty of time to get comfortable with them.
